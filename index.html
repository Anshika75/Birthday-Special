                5 <sup>th</sup> April, a common date for others, but very special for me as on this date, not only me, but also my elder brother was born, more like my elder twin. Though we never met in reality, but the relation is kinda: "Though not by blood, but connected by destiny".<br> Never thought while strolling through a random coding app and getting known to unknown virtual humans I will find a person who will get so close to me that loosing him would become the worst nightmare of mine. Getting him as my evil twin brother, always make me believe in the existence of destiny and good deeds.

            <div class="txtbox tt">Forseeing my future workload, I hereby declare that this may be my last birthday code for long time in future, and it gives me immense pleasure to dedicate this code to one of the most important person of my life. Now many of those who might know me would be in a dilemma that how can he be so importan, but that's how my life turned. We never had a relationship of day night talking and all that stuff. With him it's always like I can tag on him without any second thought, no matter how tuff the situation is. Many times it happened that we were not availabe for each other at the most crucial time, but it never got deteriorated. We complaint to each other, we bickered but our bond always got stronger. </div>

            <div class="txtbox">We have known each other for more than 1 year, and have let in each other, in our own dark worlds, but the miracle is no one of us ever got scared, we supported each other, we never made eternity promises or that stuff but at the end of the day we knew that we would have each others shoulder to cry, to share every problems of ours. We even shared the most stupid of our problems and whatever that comes to our minds without any fear of cross judging or any other fears. Never thought a bond made over a simple hello would ever mean so much in my life.</div>

            <div class="txtbox tt">Today is my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, of which I dreamt of so many things, and regarded it as my most important day but it's true life is uncertain and the future is unpredictable and so here I am without my mother (who never missed even one of my birthday) and no other hopes. The previous 5 days were quite a rollercoaster ride for me, but even at such worst times, he tried his best to comfort me, and to make me smile. He was there as a constant support and motivator for me. Made me feel like yes, I have someone to rely on, someone to celebrate my birthday though virtually but it do means a lot for me.</div>

            <div class="txtbox">At the end just few words for you bhaiya, first of all soooo sorry for this simple and boring code but due to lack of time but my determination to say these words and let everyone know how special you are, made me come out with this code. Secondly thankkkkkk youuuuuuu sooooooo much for being there, making me smile even at my worst times and understandig me when no one did. I won't be talking about future or future promises, I would just say that the time I spent after knowing you is the most beutiful time ever and being selfish I do hope this time never ends. Once again Happy Birthday Bhaiya. May all your wishes comes true and you have a never ending smile on your face forever. Wishing you a year filled with joy, success and prosperity. And yeah! a lot of maggi, chocolates and ice creams.</div>
